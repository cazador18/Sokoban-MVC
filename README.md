# Sokoban-MVC
The "Sokoban-MVC" project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This architecture divides the application into three main components - the Model, View, and Controller - to ensure logical and structural separation.

Here's an overview of each component in the MVC architecture:

Model: The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. In the "Sokoban-MVC" project, the Model likely includes classes that describe levels, the game board, characters, boxes, target positions, and other entities related to the game process. The Model handles data operations, updates its state, and notifies the Controllers of any changes.

View: The View is responsible for displaying the Model's data to the user and handling user interactions. In the "Sokoban-MVC" project, the View probably includes classes that display the game board and other user interface elements. The View receives data from the Model and renders it on the screen, as well as sends user input to the Controllers for processing.

Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It manages the game logic and handles user input. In the "Sokoban-MVC" project, the Controller likely includes classes that process user events, interact with the Model, and update the View accordingly.

By employing the MVC architecture, the "Sokoban-MVC" project achieves separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular, maintainable, and scalable. The Model encapsulates the data and business rules, the View focuses on presentation and user interaction, and the Controller coordinates the flow of data and user actions between the Model and the View.
